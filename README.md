# CustomTabBar
I developed a CustomTabbar for one of our Swift projects currently running at Space-O Technologies. 

I’ve to work hard to develop this custom side menu in Swift, so I thought to share it with you guys so you can easily implement it hassle-free later on.  

Check this Swift Tutorial on [How to Create a CustomTabbar or Side Menu with One Common Code Structure?](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/swift-tutorial-create-customtabbar-side-menu-one-common-code-structure/)

Please do ask me if you've any questions related to Swift development or want to [hire Swift developer](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-swift-developer/), who can dedicatedly work on your project.     

##CustomLayouts
###Easily create your custom tab bar or side menu with one common code structure.<br />
   We created one common class to create your complex UI easy and you can add lots of animations in your UI designing.<br />
   Let’s see how it works. We are showing one simple demo to create custom tab bar with animation.<br />
   Import “ATTabbar” into your project.<br />
   You have to specify your home controller which manages our tabor.<br />
   For our example our home controller is “Viewcontroller.h” file.<br />
   Here you need to add “ContainerView”. This view will manage our different tab based controllers.<br />
   “ATTabbar” is custom segue class to manage different view controllers in “ContainerView”.<br />
   From our demo project you will get more idea how things works.<br />
   Using this custom segue you can make lots of different kind of layouts. See few enclosed app’s screenshot which uses this code methodology.<br />

### We have few custom layout designs also which you can achieve from our base code.<br />
