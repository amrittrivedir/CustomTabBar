# CustomTabBar
Create your own unique custom TabBar OR SideMenu with custom segue classes. 

##CustomLayouts
###Easily create your custom tab bar or side menu with one common code structure.<br />
   We created one common class to create your complex UI easy and you can add lots of animations in your UI designing.<br />
   Let’s see how it works. We are showing one simple demo to create custom tab bar with animation.<br />
   Import “ATTabbar” into your project.<br />
   You have to specify your home controller which manages our tabor.<br />
   For our example our home controller is “Viewcontroller.h” file.<br />
   Here you need to add “ContainerView”. This view will manage our different tab based controllers.<br />
   “ATTabbar” is custom segue class to manage different view controllers in “ContainerView”.<br />
   From our demo project you will get more idea how things works.<br />
   Using this custom segue you can make lots of different kind of layouts. See few enclosed app’s screenshot which uses this code methodology.<br />
